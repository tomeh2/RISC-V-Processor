Phase 10 Post Router Timing

Phase 10.1 Update Timing
Phase 10.1 Update Timing | Checksum: 1d0ceb1f9

Time (s): cpu = 00:01:21 ; elapsed = 00:01:03 . Memory (MB): peak = 1996.953 ; gain = 148.844
INFO: [Route 35-57] Estimated Timing Summary | WNS=5.365  | TNS=0.000  | WHS=-0.645 | THS=-3.349 |

WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.
